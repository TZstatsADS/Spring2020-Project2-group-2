### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](doc/screenshot2.png)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: In New York, there are usually news about unarrested criminals who have comitted a crime, especially around neighbourhoods, which makes us feel upset. And New York Police are trying their best to keep our residents safe.
  
 	Our shiny app is based on the official NYPD arrest records in New York City of the last 5 years (2013-2018).  The target users for this project, include residents, the NYPD and Policy Makers. Through our app, residents can know where different kinds of criminals appear and are arrested during each year and each borough, so that they can be informed of when and where criminals are more likely to appear and keep away from such areas. For police, given the past data, they can make predictions as to when and where different types of criminals will appear and try their best to catch them and maintain public safety. Policy makers will be able to study demographics of the arrests (age, gender, and race) for different types of crimes, different years, and boroughs and determine whether unfair bias exists based on different boroughs such as racism and gender inequality.
