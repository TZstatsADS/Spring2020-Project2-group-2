In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: In New York, there are usually news about unarrested criminals who have comitted a crime, especially around neighbourhoods, which makes us feel upset. And New York Police are trying their best to keep our residents safe.
  
 	Our shinh app is about arrest map in New York City, we have three types of target users: Recidents, NYPC and Policy Makers. For residents, through our app, they can know when and where different kinds of criminals appear and get arrested during each year and each borough, so that they can have an total understanding of when and where many unarrest criminal may appear and keep away from that place. For police, given the past data, they can predict when and where different types of unarrested criminals will appear and try their best to catch them and keep the society safe. For policy makers, they can know the age, gender and race in different types of crimes happened in different year and borough and figure out whether there exists something unfair based on different borough such as racism, gender inequality, educational injustices and so on.
